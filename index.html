                        I have a bit of a crazy story.  I'll try to make it brief.  

During High School I played tennis pretty well, was expecting to get some full rides to school until shoulder injury derailed that.  Worked various jobs; line cook in a few restaurants, ER -tech then Emt, tennis coach, anything to be out and busy.
In undergrad I was a theater/biology major. I know weird combo. I thought I liked acting, turned out I liked set design and construction. Worked at some theaters as a scenic carpenter made some decent money blew it away on learning to fly.  Met a sound engineer, became friends started working numerous concerts during school and summer break. Again, money good, lifestyle horrible.  Lost the entertainment bug decided to go into medicine. 

Upon graduating med school found out my father had a rare eye disease. I said OK, I'll go into research and find the cure.  Easier said than done.  Worked/struggled to make a difference for 8 years then the entrepreneur bug hit.  Decided to open a food truck. Went all in, quit the medicine career to work full time running a moving restaurant.  

Soon realized that I was working 100 hour weeks, wasn't able to see my two little kids much so decided that adventure had to end.

Back into medical research I went, still trying to make a difference though spend a majority of my time muddling through copious amounts of data and numbers. Why can't there be an easier way? Why can't the developers make what we need? 

So here I am, trying to learn how to make things work for us. Whether it be web apps, backend data management or front end tools for researchers. Not the usual way or reason to get into this but here I go!
